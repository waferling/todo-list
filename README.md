## :pushpin: The Process
For this todo list project, I wanted an interface that was unlike the todo lists references I'd come across, and a worthwhile feature I wanted in was local storage, so even upon refreshes or closing the tab altogether- your tasks remain safe in the browser. I started off with the structure and positioning, then went in with Javascript and used icons for the checkbox and cross-mark. Getting the icons to sit correctly was a bit tricky, but sizing them properly and adjusting positioning did the trick.

Strikethrough text and word-wrapping made the application have a nice touch. It was interesting to see how simple local storage was to implement, even though it sounded like a big task initially. Overall, this was a fun project and great for making quick lists in my experience. I also worked on responsivity, making it ready-to-use for all screen sizes.
